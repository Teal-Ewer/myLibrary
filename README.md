# myLibrary

This app is a virtual bookshelf! It allows you to search for books you own using the Google Books API and add them to your collection. You can see other user's bookshelves and leave reviews on any book.  You can also mark if your copy of a book is lent out.

## Getting Started

[This link](https://teals-library.herokuapp.com/) will take you to the deployed app.  Sign in with a Google account and start adding books!
